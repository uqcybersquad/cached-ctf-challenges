We have intercepted an encrypted message with critical information, and also managed to recover the machine that is able to decrypt it, with a copy of the source program it should run to decrypt the message. The crazy scientist that built this machine was accidentally killed during the extraction. It's a very elaborate mechanical machine with tons of pipes and valves but we managed to reverse-engineer its logic and build a simulation out of it, but now we need to convert the source of the program into something that the machine is able to understand and execute! The encrypted message is already loaded into the simulation.
