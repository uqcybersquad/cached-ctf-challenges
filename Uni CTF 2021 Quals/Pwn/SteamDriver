The GNU/Linux community has infiltrated the transportation industry of this steampunk world! They are forcing us to open source our flying locomotive's internal device driver which interfaces with our automated steam engine management mainframes! None of us understand how it works, and we cannot find the intern who wrote this driver. Can you please verify the security of this codebase for us?
